// Event definitions. Two rules apply here:
//
// 1. Four topics is a hard ceiling. The SDK's type system does not enforce it,
//    so nothing stops a fifth `#[topic]` being added by mistake.
// 2. High-cardinality fields (`vault_id`, `amount`, `asset` on the whitelist
//    events) go in data, not topics.
//
// Rule 2 has a consequence the off-chain reader has to live with: because
// `asset` is data on WhitelistEvent and DelistEvent, it cannot be used as an
// RPC topic filter, so the backend must decode every one of those events and
// inspect the payload to derive the current whitelist.
//
// UNVERIFIED: none of these structs specify `#[contractevent(topics = [...])]`
// explicitly, so the macro applies its default topic naming, and whether that
// prepends an implicit name topic has never been checked against the pinned
// SDK version. That changes every event's real topic count. Confirm it by
// publishing each event type in a test and asserting `env.events().all()`
// rather than reasoning about it.
